# Time-series Forecasting

Time series forecasting is an important research topic in machine learning due to its prevalence in social and scientific applications. Multi-model forecasting paradigm, including model hybridization and model combination, is shown to be more effective than single-model forecasting in the M4 competition. In this study, we hybridize exponential smoothing with transformer architecture to capture both levels and seasonal patterns while exploiting the complex non-linear trend in time series data. We show that our model can capture complex trends and seasonal patterns with moderately improvement in comparison to the state-of-the-arts result from the M4 competition.

## Usage
Below is a list of currently supported components:
* Naive:  This benchmark model produces a forecast that is equal to the last observed value for a given time series.
* Seasonal Naive:  This benchmark model produces a forecast that is equal to
  the last observed value of the same season for a given time series.
* Naive2: a popular benchmark model for time series forecasting that automatically adapts
  to the potential seasonality of a series based on an autocorrelation test.
  If the series is seasonal, the model composes the predictions of Naive and Seasonal Naive. Otherwise, the model predicts on the simple Naive.
* Exponential smoothing: Using multiplicative Holt-Winter exponential smoothing to capture the potential error, seasonal, and trend.  
* Transformer: Using time-series transformer to optimize the trend.

To reproduce an experiment, run the following command:
```
source shell/add_pwd_to_pythonpath.sh
python examples/main.py --cfg examples/daily.yml
```
